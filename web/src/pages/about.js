            I began film photography in 2019 out of a desire to capture life in its raw, beautiful,
            fleeting moments. I am committed to capturing your vision and curating your story
            honestly and passionately. I believe strongly in empathy, kindness, and human
            connection. I realize that being a part of these important and intimate moments is a big
            responsibility, and not something I take lightly. I look forward to developing
            meaningful friendships as I work alongside you!
